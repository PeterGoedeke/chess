# chess
Playable CLI chess. Versions in JavaScript, Python, and Haskell. Unfinished.

The main point of this project is to demonstrate that I can program in multiple programming languages and in multiple programming paradigms to at least a reasonable level. Currently the Python version should be essentially finished, but I will likely come back and improve on it and do some refactoring.
